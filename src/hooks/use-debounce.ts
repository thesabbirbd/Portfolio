 * ⚡ Bolt: useDebounce hook to prevent excessive state updates
 * 💡 What: Delays state updates until a specified time has passed without further changes.
 * 🎯 Why: Prevents expensive re-renders and computations (like filtering large lists) on every keystroke.
 * 📊 Impact: Reduces rapid successive re-renders by grouping them into a single update after the user stops typing.
